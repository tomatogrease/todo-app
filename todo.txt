 * When you arrive on the page without an ID, load the first tasklist and its associated tasks.

 * When you arrive on the page with an ID, load the tasks associated with that tasklist id.
 *     http://root/%tlID% -> re-renders mid part.
 *  
 * No page redirects/refreshes when adding/removing/acting on tasks or taskslists
